Today [Sam](http://twitter.com/thesamwillis) and I are introducing [Design+Banter](http://designandbanter.com): a get-together for designers. Every month, a group of talented web designers will gather in London to trade stories, share ideas, drink beer, bowl and play table tennis.

When I moved to London 3 years ago, starting in a new city, I found it hard to build up a group of designers who could be friends, advisors and helpful critics. I'm a friendly guy, I get along with people, but the problem was that there was nowhere in particular in London that these elusive design unicorns gathered.

I wanted to go somewhere to discuss what I was working on with other designers, to get feedback and ideas, but I couldn't find that place.

Working in a startup, I was the only designer in an office with engineering, sales and marketing guys. They were great people, but sometimes I just wanted to grab a beer and talk shit about fonts, or floats, or flat design. This didn't sound like their ideal evening.

Unsurprisingly, when I explained all this to other designers I have bumped into over the years, they often have had the same experience. One described it was wanting a Dribble but in the real world, with actually useful feedback and maybe some beers.

So that's exactly what we're going to do.

The first Design+Banter will be on June 3rd. You can find all the details here. The format is simple. There will be four talks, seven minutes each: two talks explaining a concept, idea or technique and two show'n'tells. Each talk will contain at least 2 minutes for questions and feedback.

If the speaker asks we will institute a "no tweet, "no Instagram" agreement for show'n'tells of work in progress.

We're feeling our way a bit with this first event, so any suggestions on format, location and speakers for the next event are greatly appreciated — [just drop me a line](mailto:go@designandbanter.com).

Finally, none of this would have been possible without the support of [Henry](https://twitter.com/henryec) and [Alex](https://twitter.com/alexanderwill) the founders of Event.ly who have helped with the logistics of the event and are also buying you all the first round of beers on the night.
