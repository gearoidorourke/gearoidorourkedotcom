The Daily Measure is sent to over 25,000 Londoners (you guessed it) each day and contains three great things to see and do over the coming 24hours.

This was a bit of a skunkworks project with the [Spoonfed](http://spoonfed.co.uk) team. I designed and built the signup site and email templates while they came up with the editorial content. The email templates make use of media queries to give an app-like experience on iOS devices.

We wanted the email to feel vibrant and colourful, but not to restrict the type of content it could contain. Using [Mailchimp's](http://mailchimp.com) templating engine, I came up with a series of coloured modules which the Spoonfed editors can choose form each day. The colours are loosely based on the identifying colours of each of London's Tube lines.
