I worked on Engage with the product team at [Evently](http://event.ly). The tool was designed to help event promoters understand what content best engaged their Facebook audience.

In December 2012 at Event.ly, we set about building some free tools for event organisers. Each was built, more or less, within the restraints of a 10% day and aimed to address a specific need. Engage was the first of these. It addresses a simple need: event promoters didn't know what Facebook content was engaging their audience most effectively.

By linking their Facebook accounts we gave them a profile by profile breakdown of what the most engaging posts were and also who engaged with them. In testing with event organisers the tool worked well and we were inundated with requests for extra features. [Try it yourself.](http://engage.event.ly)
