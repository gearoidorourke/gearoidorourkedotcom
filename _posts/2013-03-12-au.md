Au is a free tool for people who use Eventbrite for their event ticketing. It fills some of the basic holes in Eventbrite's own cross-event reporting.

Many of Evently's customers use [Eventbrite](http://eventbrite.com) as the main ticketing provider for their events. From conversations with our customers we realised that there were some holes in the cross event reporting in the Eventbrite dashboard. As part of a '10% time' project we built Au to address some of these.

With Au you can see how far in advance attendees buy tickets, how many events they attend, how many tickets to each event they purchased, what the first and last event they attended were and what their total spend on your events to-date has been. These were all data points that our customers wanted to used in structuring their event marketing.
